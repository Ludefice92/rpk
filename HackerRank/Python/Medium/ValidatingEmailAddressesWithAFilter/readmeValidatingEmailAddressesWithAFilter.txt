Concept

A filter takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence, returning a list of only those members of the sequence where the function returned True. A Lambda function can be used with filters.

Let's say you have to make a list of the squares of integers from  to  (both included).

>> l = list(range(10))
>> l = list(map(lambda x:x*x, l))
Now, you only require those elements that are greater than  but less than .

>> l = list(filter(lambda x: x > 10 and x < 80, l))
Easy, isn't it?
